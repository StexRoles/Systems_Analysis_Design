# Systems Analysis - Kaggle Competition: Eedi - Mining Misconceptions in Mathematics

## General Description

This project consists of a systems analysis applied to the Kaggle competition **Eedi - Mining Misconceptions in Mathematics**, 
which poses the challenge of predicting misconceptions that students may have when answering multiple-choice math questions.

The main objective was to decompose and understand the different elements that make up the competition system, 
using the principles of **systems theory**. Its key components, their relationships, and their joint function as a 
system aimed at improving learning through artificial intelligence were addressed.

## Stages of analysis

1. **System identification**  
   The competency was defined as a system composed of multiple interdependent elements, with the purpose of identifying conceptual errors in student responses.
   
2. **System components**  
   The following elements were identified and described:
   - Training and test data.
   - Target and predictor variables.
   - Evaluation metrics used (MAP@25).
   - Participation rules and restrictions.
   - Prizes and incentives.

3. **Application of Systems Engineering Concepts**
Concepts such as inputs, processes, outputs, and feedback were used. The purpose of the system, its environment, and the delimitation of the system from the suprasystem (mathematics education and data science) were also considered.

4. **Relationship between system elements**
We analyzed how the different components interact to fulfill the common purpose: improving understanding of the learning process through the analysis of common errors.

5. **System Sensitivity Analysis**
We evaluated how variations in certain parameters (for example, changes in predictions or the inclusion of new data) can affect the overall behavior of the system and its performance on the MAP@25 metric.

6. **Chaos theory applied to the system**
The possibility that small variations in initial conditions (such as the classification of a distractor or the choice of model architecture) can generate unpredictable or divergent behavior was explored, which is relevant when evaluating the nonlinear behavior of the educational system.

7. **Conclusions of the analysis**  
   Using all the information obtained previously from the analysis, solid conclusions are drawn regarding the system.
